5.2.0

- Massive (unfortunately, sometimes not backward-compatible) overhauling
  of the interface specification and of the implementation to reduce the
  amount of parameter checks and special cases.

- The default size of the bucket at creation in a BucketedHashStore has
  been raised to 256 (it used to be one) to avoid that calls to
  checkAndRetry() on a newly created store are too expensive.

- BucketedHashStore now return the bucket index as a long (this is
  unfortunately not backward-compatible for some applications). This
  change was necessary as buckets can be more than Integer.MAX_VALUE.
  All user classes now throw an exception if the number of keys is
  so large than the resulting number of buckets would be greater than
  Integer.MAX_VALUE.

5.1.5

- Fast forward iterations in
  EliasFanoMonotoneLongBigList/EliasFanoPrefixSumBigList and skipping by
  value when iterating over an EliasFanoIndexedMonotoneLongBigList.

5.1.4

- Several new methods for EliasFanoIndexedMonotoneLongBigList.

5.1.3

- Released to fix dependency on broken dsiutils 2.1.13.

5.1.2

- New indexed version of EliasFanoMonotoneLongBigList.

- OSGi metadata and default modularization.

- Manual reduction in strength in arithmetic operations everywhere.

5.1.1

- Added automatic module name.

5.1.0

- GOV/GV functions now allow arbitrary data sizes, thanks to the
  new LongBigArrayBitVector class in the DSI utilities.

- Fixed SLF4J dependencies (again).

5.0.4

- We now use the classifier in naming artifacts.

5.0.3

- Fixed build.xml: moved to Java 9, more explicit dependency naming.

5.0.2

- Fixed old bug in SimpleSelect. Thanks to Richard Webb for reporting
  this bug.

5.0.1

- New EliasFanoMonotoneLongBigList16 class supporting very large
  lists with fixed lower-bits width 16 (bypassing the LongArrayBitVector
  128Gib limit).

5.0.0

- Major revamp of the it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.mph package.

4.3.0

- Several fixes and improvements.

4.2.0

- Java 8-only.

- New compressed functions (GV3CompressedFunction and
  GV4CompressedFunction) which store a mapping key/value using a number of
  bits per key close to the empirical entropy of the list of values.

- Parallel, multithreaded construction for GOV3Function, GOV4Function,
  GOVMinimalPerfectHashFunction, GV3CompressedFunction and GV4CompressedFunction).

4.1.0

- We now use in all the new structures of the mph package a modulo-free
  range reduction based on a integer-simulated floating point computation
  (see http://www.drdobbs.com/tools/fast-high-quality-parallel-random-number/231000484).
  This has improved lookup performance by 5-10% but it has made necessary
  to bump the serial version UIDs.

- Fixed wrong mask in Rank12. It could lead to unpredictable
  errors.

4.0.0

- Complete revamp of the mph package. New algorithms provide
  better space and faster lookup. Please read carefully the
  package documentation.

- Older maps such as MWHCFunction, MinimalPerfectHashFunction
  and TwoStepsMWHCFunction have been deprecated, and will be
  removed sooner or later.

- All serial version UIDs have been updated.

- We now use SpookyHash.

- We now support, for all functions for which it is possible, 
  raw (i.e., non-lexicographical) transformation strategies
  (as they are faster).

- Fixed a lot of documentations, main methods, etc.

- Several functions can now be built from the command line
  using byte-arrays as keys; strings are read without any
  decoding.

3.2.2

- Improved speed for selection in a word thanks to an idea of Giuseppe
  Ottaviano. Now we refer to the implementation found in the DSI
  utilities (it.unimi.dsi.bits.Fast.select()).

3.2.1

- Fixed dependencies.

3.2.0

- New Rank11 and Rank12 implementations with new space/speed tradeoffs.
  Taken from Simon Gog and Mathias Petri's paper.

- New ranking structure for MinimalPerfectHashFunction based on Rank11,
  which made it necessary to bump the serialVersionUID.

- New HashDisplaceCompressMinimalPerfectHashFunction class implementing a
  new technique by Belazzougui, Botelho and Dietzfelbinger, providing
  minimal perfect hashing at 2.05 bits per key. Construction time is an
  order of magnitude larger than MinimalPerfectHashFunction, and queries
  are ~50% slower, so we will keep the other implementation as a reference
  for the time being.

3.1.2

- Revised adapter (now renamed SignedFunctionStringMap) to accept
  generic Object2Long<? extends CharSequence> functions, discovering
  dynamically whether they implement Size64.
  
3.1.1

- New thin adapter SignedObject2LongFunctionStringMap to adapt the new
  Sux4J self-signing functions to the StringMap (big) interface. The
  adapter implements also a constructor based on an Iterable that
  can be used directly with MG4J's IndexBuilder.

- New bulk get() methods for EliasFanoLongBigList,
  EliasFanoMonotoneLongBigList and select() for SimpleSelect. They are
  built one upon each other and they are an order of magnitude faster than
  picking consecutive elements using getLong()/select().

3.1.0

- MinimalPerfectHashFunction, MWHCFunction,
  LcpMonotoneMinimalPerfectHashFunction,
  TwoStepsLcpMonotoneMinimalPerfectHashFunction and
  ZFastTrieDistributorMonotoneMinimalPerfectHashFunction have now built-in
  signing. The effort was relatively small, and the gain in speed is huge,
  as we can use part of the hash computed by the ChunkedHashStore as a
  signature.

- New "dictionary" option in MWHCFunction which stores the signature as a
  value. It gives the fastest and most compact probabilistic dictionary.

- Big switch to builders for MinimalPerfectHashFunction, MWHCFunction,
  TwoStepsMWHCFunction, LcpMonotoneMinimalPerfectHashFunction,
  TwoStepsLcpMonotoneMinimalPerfectHashFunction and
  ZFastTrieDistributorMonotoneMinimalPerfectHashFunction. As a final goal,
  all multiple constructors will be eliminated in favour of Guava-style static
  nested Builder classes.

- Major speed improvements in
  ZFastTrieDistributorMonotoneMinimalPerfectHashFunction.

3.0.11

- Now we use XorShift1024StarRandom everywhere.

3.0.10

- New parameter to MWHCFunction makes it possible to build arbitrary
  functions from the command line.

3.0.9

- Added for efficiency a lowerBitsMask field to
  EliasFanoMonotoneLongBigList, which made it necessary to bump the
  serialVersionUID.

- Aligned the behaviour of EliasFanoMonotoneLongBigList with that of
  MG4J's implementation--the upper bound is not necessarily strict.

- Fixed subtle bug in ChunkedHashStore that could cause an out-of-bounds
  access to an array in the (very rare) case of a retry.

- The documentation of Jenkins hashes was still stating, erroneously,
  that we return the first computed value (we return the third one).

- Deprecated length() methods have been removed.

- Added UTF-32 support to all classes.

3.0.8

- Significantly improved speed of SimpleSelect and all related
  classes (Elias-Fano lists, etc.).

- Improved speed of MinimalPerfectHashFunction.

- Integer overflow bugs fixes (thanks to Tim Potter).

3.0.7

- Some monotone hash functions would crash during construction due to an
  integer overflow. Thanks to Tim Potter for reporting this bug.

3.0.6

- Switched to SLF4J for logging.

3.0.5

- The Ivy dependency file has been Maven-normalized (now we have a
  default "compile" scope).

3.0.3

- Replaced methods from it.unimi.dsi.bits.Fast with equivalent methods in
  Integer/Long, as recent JVMs intrinsify such methods.

3.0.2

- Fixed minor inconsistencies in the values returned on empty functions
  (some implementations would actually throw an exception). Thanks to
  Valentin Tablan for reporting the problem.

3.0

- WARNING: This release has minor binary incompatibilities with previous
  releases, mainly due to the move from the interface
  it.unimi.dsi.util.LongBigList to the now standard
  it.unimi.dsi.fasutil.longs.LongBigList. It is part of a parallel release
  of fastutil, the DSI Utilities, Sux4J, MG4J, WebGraph, etc. that were
  all modified to fit the new interface, and that prepare the way for our
  "big" versions, that is, supporting >2^31 entries in arrays (simulated),
  elements in lists, terms, documents, nodes, etc. Please read our (short)
  "Moving Java to Big Data" document (JavaBig.pdf) for details.

- We now require Java 6.

- it.unimi.dsi.util.LongBigList is dead. Long live to
  it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.longs.LongBigList. We're sorry for the
  nuisance--adapting the code should be very easy (and we warned you
  anyway :).

- MWHCFunction has been re-engineered so that it will use very little
  space beside that actually required by the function. Previously, a
  number of large bit vectors were allocated at the same time, and they
  have been replaced by a judicious use of OfflineIterable. All classes
  that use MWHCFunction will benefit (at the expense of slightly increased
  disk usage and access).

- All classes should support big collections. They use the new Size64
  interface from fastutil. Implementations still support the old
  (deprecated) length() method for backward compatibility.

- New FileLinesBigList class.

- We now have a MurmurHash3 full implementation.

2.0.1

- Sux4J is now distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public
  License 3.

- Major rewriting of the hypergraph peeling code. Now we use less memory
  and we are definitely faster.

- MWHCFunction and MinimalPerfectHashFunction accept a temporary directory
  for the chunked hash store files.

- Improved ChunkedHashStore architecture that allow arbitrary values,
  so functions can be built without keeping values in memory.

- Fixed bug in MinimalPerfetHashFunction that was causing exceptions
  when using more than a billion keys (thanks to Wei Liu for reporting
  and fixing this bug).

- Fixed bug in some rank/select classes that was causing integer overflow
  errors when building structure over bit vectors with >2Gi bits.

- AbstractLongBitVector.equals() now uses getLong() on word boundaries.

- Fixed pernicious bug in Select9.

2.0

- General revamp, restructuring, improvements, new coherent names for
  classes. Most of the code has been rewritten or improved.

- New (partial) structures for balanced parentheses.

- New build system based on ChunkedHashStore that works for billions
  of keys.

- New structures for balanced parentheses (partially implemented).

- Faster Select9 operation: some broadword operations were implemented in
  a redundant way.

- SparseSelect/SparseRank would give an incorrect (or at least little
  useful) value for numBits() when using shared data.

- Fixed problem with SparseSelect: some methods inherited from
  EliasFanoMonotoneBigList were causing exceptions because the size of the
  SparseSelect is the number of bits, not the number of ones.

- New hollow trie implementation based on balanced parentheses.

- Fixed an old and severe bug in MinimalPerfectHashFunction, that
  was causing the generated functions not to be perfect.

1.0.4

- New progressive hash-computation methods that provide Jenkins hash
  in constant time on all prefixes (after a linear-time preprocessing).

1.0.3

- New TwoStepsMWHCFunction that records in s<r bits the most
  frequent values.

- Much improved relative trie implementation (uses two-steps MWHC functions, too).

- New TwoStepsLCPMonotoneMinimalPerfectHashFunction: it is slightly slow
  than an LCPMonotoneMinimalPerfectHashFunction, but consumes significantly
  less space thanks to a two-steps MWHC function.

1.0.2

- Fixed bug in SimpleSelectZero: under certain conditions, an error in
  counting zeroes was causing a out-of-bounds array access.

- Fixed gross bug in MWHCFunction. It wasn't working for bit width
  beyond 32.

- New data structure (RelativeTrieMonotoneMinimalPerfectHashFunction).

1.0.1

- Fixed wrong name of PaCo-trie-based monotone minimal
  perfect hash functions.

- Fixed small misbehaviours on very small key sets.

- New data structure (HollowTrieMonotoneMinimalPerfectHashFunction)
  that uses just 3.44 + 1.23 log log l bits per element.

1.0

- Fixed Jenkins hash so that it works with empty strings.

- Some class renamed.

- Rethought command-line argument parsing.

- Now monotone minimal perfect hashing classes.

- ShiftAddXorSignedStringMap moved to the DSI utilities.

- New classes for compressed lists based on the Elias-Fano
  representation.

0.3

- New rank/select structures.

- Restructuring following release of the DSI utilities: bit vectors
  implementations have been moved there.

- New signing classes that implement StringMap and make it possible to
  mimick the old MG4J SignedMinimalPerfectHash behaviour.

0.1

- First release.
